# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This mini-project explores the foundational machine learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch and evaluating them on well-known datasets. The goal is to deepen the understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood and assess their real-world performance.

## üîç Objective

To implement, visualize, and evaluate classic machine learning algorithms including the Perceptron, Backpropagation for neural networks, Naive Bayes classifier, PCA, and Hierarchical Clustering using real datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, 20 Newsgroups, Fashion-MNIST, and Breast Cancer.
