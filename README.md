# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This mini-project explores the foundational machine learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch and evaluating them on well-known datasets. The goal is to deepen the understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood and assess their real-world performance.

## üîç Objective

To implement, visualize, and evaluate classic machine learning algorithms including the Perceptron, Backpropagation for neural networks, Naive Bayes classifier using real datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, 20 Newsgroups, Fashion-MNIST, and Breast Cancer.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### 1. Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- **Dataset**: MNIST (filtered to digits 0 and 1)
- **Goal**: Binary classification using the Perceptron algorithm
- **Steps**:
  - Data preprocessing and label filtering
  - Implementation of the perceptron learning rule
  - Dimensionality reduction via PCA for 2D visualization
  - Visualization of decision boundary
  - **Discussion**: Limitations of perceptron in high-dimensional data spaces
